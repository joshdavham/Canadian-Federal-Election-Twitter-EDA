A short Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the English-language tweets made by the five major party leaders during the 2019 Canadian Federal Election period.

Each tweet has been manually labelled as to whether it contained content relative to any of the five topics discussed during the English-Language debate - (1) Affordability and Economic Insecurity, (2) Environment and Energy, (3) Indigenous Issues, (4) National and Global Leadership, (5) Polarization, Human Rights and Immigration.

The PCA plots in this analysis always contain data from the tweets of all leaders, but on different political topics.

The Wordplots can be used to gain an understanding of the language being used on Twitter for each of the polital topics and how the leaders tend to tweet about these topics differently.

Unfortunately, due to Twitter's policy, I am not allowed to share the data that I scraped -- neither raw or clean. I can, however, show the results!
